abstract: "On the basis of data collected from the largest Internet portal in Russia with advertisements
for the sale of used passenger cars ńauto.ruż, this paper investigated the dependence of the
cost of a vehicle in the secondary market on factors such as brand, model, year of manufacture,
mileage, engine power, the condition of the body and the car as a whole, equipment and
other indicators of the condition and quality of the vehicle. The study used the methods of
multivariate statistical analysis using the software package SPSS for statistical data processing.
As a result, it was possible to identify the most signiőcant factors affecting the cost of a
used car, to establish the nature and strength of the relationship between the dependent
variable and the parameters under study, and also, using the example of speciőc car models,
to construct regression equations that can be used to estimate the value of a vehicle before
buying or selling it on the secondary market."
